# BinaryDataNunit

If you comment out [this line](https://github.com/m-nash/BinaryDataNunit/blob/main/BinaryDataNunit/TestClass.cs#L7) the test will run.
If it is uncommented the tests will not be found because there is some exception somewhere.

The only difference is that the top test uses a test case source which contains an empty BinaryData and the bottom one does not.
